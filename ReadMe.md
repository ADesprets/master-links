The purpose of this page is to help find reusable assets in the integration space with IBM products.

For now it is just myself sharing what I have found but I will be happy to take your good advises (please use the pull request feature so you can get recognise of your contribution).

The idea is to describe each asset at some point with an automated approach (using github graphql api for example) to facilitate the retrieval of useful assets in the integration space.
Below is a sample of template but it is under construction.
